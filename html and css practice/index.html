    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi,
        I am Pragya Mishra, a Varanasi native. I am fresher but I have basic knowledge in frontend Development.
        As far as my qualification is concerned, I secured BCA graduation in Computer Science and Engineering
         from Babu Banarsi Das Institute Of Technology Ghaziabad, under Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University,
          Lucknow in 2023, and some certifications like Core Java Development from Smart Programming Mohali,
           and Computer System Security from IIT Kanpur during my graduation.
        About my strength, I’m flexible and adoptable towards my work and always keen to learn new things.
         I’m a hard worker and I work smart. With respect to weakness, shyness was the one I faced earlier
          and now I was able to overcome it with confidence and passion towards work. 
        As I am a fresher, I have theoretical/coding knowledge, but I can do hardwork for my organization,
         and I will put all my efforts for the good progress of my organization. Being punctual and sincere,
          I can finish the work given to me on time and try to fulfil all the needs of the company from me.<br></p>
